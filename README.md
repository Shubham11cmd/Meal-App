# Meal-App

Create a meal app to store and search meals. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for Javascript (you can use any css framework like Bootstrap).

Features
•	Home Page
o	Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
o	Each search result of the meal should have a favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to “My favourite meals” (a list).
o	On clicking any particular search result (any meal), open a new page with more information about that meal(meal page)
